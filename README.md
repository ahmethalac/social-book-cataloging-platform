# Social Cataloging Platform for Books (i. e. Goodreads)

The Social Cataloging Platform for Books contains various and large amounts of data coming from actors of the system which are users, authors and librarians. These actors can perform wide range of actions such as publishing books, adding friends, joining challanges bringing togather the book catologing and social networks platforms. The use of a database is necessary to store such large data in a distributed manner. With this system, a lot of data can be stored easily and it is easy to keep it regularly when needed.By using a database system, it becomes possible to reach and use various information and actions quickly and efficiently.

At the same time, database usage is reliable for storing data. It allows forming complex queries to manipulate volumes of data in a persistent manner. With the database management system, permission conditions are determined to access data. It can prevent unauthorized access to data, and backup of data is provided due to system crashes or corruption. That's why we use databases in our project to control and access all these interrelated data easily and efficiently.
